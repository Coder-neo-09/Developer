## 🔄 JavaScript `while` Loops – Repeat Until Condition Changes

---

A **`while` loop** repeats a block of code **as long as** a given condition is `true`.
It’s best for **unknown number of repetitions** until something happens.

---

## 🧩 1. Basic Syntax

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code to run
}
```

✅ The condition is checked **before** each loop.
✅ If the condition is **false** at the start, the loop never runs.

---

## 📌 2. Basic Example

```javascript
let count = 1;

while (count <= 5) {
  console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
  count++;
}
```

Output:

```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

---

## ⚠ 3. Infinite Loop Warning

```javascript
while (true) {
  console.log("This never stops!");
}
```

🚨 Without changing the condition, it loops forever. Always ensure a **break condition**.

---

## ⏩ 4. Using `break` Inside While

```javascript
let number = 1;

while (true) {
  console.log(number);
  if (number === 5) break; // stop at 5
  number++;
}
```

---

## 🔁 5. `do...while` Loop

Runs the block **at least once**, even if the condition is false at first.

```javascript
let num = 10;

do {
  console.log(num);
  num++;
} while (num <= 12);
```

Output:

```
10
11
12
```

## 🌍 Real-World Example: ATM PIN Retry System

This covers:

* `while` for retry attempts
* `break` to stop early
* `do...while` for mandatory first attempt

```javascript
let correctPin = "1234";
let enteredPin;
let attempts = 0;
let maxAttempts = 3;

do {
  enteredPin = prompt("Enter your PIN:");
  attempts++;

  if (enteredPin === correctPin) {
    console.log("✅ PIN correct. Access granted.");
    break;
  } else {
    console.log(`❌ Wrong PIN. Attempts left: ${maxAttempts - attempts}`);
  }

} while (attempts < maxAttempts);

if (attempts === maxAttempts && enteredPin !== correctPin) {
  console.log("🚫 Account locked due to too many failed attempts.");
}
```

## ✅ Summary

| Concept       | Description                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `while`       | Runs while condition is `true`               |
| `do...while`  | Runs once before checking the condition      |
| `break`       | Exits the loop early                         |
| Infinite loop | Happens when condition never becomes `false` |

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Always **update variables** inside the loop to avoid infinite loops
* Use `do...while` when at least one execution is needed
* Keep loop logic small — move large operations into functions
* Track a **counter** when you need limited attempts
