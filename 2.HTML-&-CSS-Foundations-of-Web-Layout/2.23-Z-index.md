# 🎯 CSS Z-Index – Layering Elements in Web Pages

The CSS `z-index` property controls the stacking order of elements on a web page along the z-axis (front-to-back). This guide covers everything from basics to real-world usage.

---

## 📌 1. What is Z-Index?
The `z-index` property determines which elements appear above others when they overlap.  
A higher `z-index` value means the element is on top, while a lower value puts it behind.

**Syntax:**
```css
.element {
  position: relative; /* or absolute, fixed, sticky */
  z-index: 5;
}
```

---

## ✅ 2. Key Points About Z-Index
- Works only on positioned elements (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`).
- The default value is `auto`.
- Can take positive, negative, or zero values.
- Elements with no positioning ignore `z-index`.

---

## 📚 3. Default Stacking Order
Without `z-index`, the browser stacks elements as follows:
1. Background/border of the root element
2. Non-positioned elements in DOM order
3. Positioned elements with `z-index: auto`
4. Positioned elements with numeric `z-index` (low → high)

---

## 🗂️ 4. Stacking Context
A **stacking context** is like a separate “layer world.”  
Once created, elements inside it are stacked relative to each other but **cannot escape** to overlap elements outside of it.

**Created by:**
- Positioned element with `z-index` not `auto`
- `opacity` < 1
- CSS `transform`, `filter`, `perspective`, etc.
- `isolation: isolate`

## 💡 5. Example
```html
<div class="box1"></div>
<div class="box2"></div>

<style>
.box1 {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
  background: red;
}
.box2 {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
  background: blue;
}
</style>
```

---

## ⚠️ 6. Negative Z-Index
Negative values push elements behind others.  
However, the element might become unclickable if placed behind the background of its stacking context.

---

## 🌍 7. Real-World Examples
- Fixed navigation bars above content (`z-index: 1000`)
- Modals & popups (`z-index: 9999`)
- Dropdown menus above page content
- Tooltips above all other elements

---

## 🛠️ 8. Best Practices
- Keep `z-index` values consistent and meaningful.
- Avoid unnecessarily large numbers like `999999`.
- Understand stacking contexts before debugging.
- Use variables/constants for `z-index` in large projects.

## 📊 9. Summary Table

| Concept             | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Higher z-index      | Element appears in front                          |
| Positioning required| Works only with `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky` |
| Stacking context    | Local layer system where `z-index` is compared    |
| Negative z-index    | Places element behind others                      |
| Default stacking    | DOM order decides when `z-index` is equal         |
