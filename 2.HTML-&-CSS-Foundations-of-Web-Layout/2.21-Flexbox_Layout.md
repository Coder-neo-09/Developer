# CSS Flexbox Layout — Detailed Guide

## 1. What is Flexbox?
**Flexbox** (Flexible Box Layout) is a one-dimensional layout system in CSS that arranges items **in a row or a column**.  
It is designed for distributing space along a single axis and aligning items within a container, even when their sizes are unknown.

- **One-dimensional**: You work with **either** rows *or* columns at a time (unlike Grid which handles both).
- Great for navigation bars, alignment, and responsive elements.

## 2. Basic Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Flex Container** | The element with `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex`. |
| **Flex Items** | Direct children of the flex container. |
| **Main Axis** | The primary axis (row or column) along which flex items are placed. |
| **Cross Axis** | The perpendicular axis to the main axis. |

---

## 3. Creating a Flexbox Container

```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
```
- `display: flex` → Makes the container a flexbox and applies flex properties to its children.
- `display: inline-flex` → Same as flex but the container itself behaves like an inline element.

---

## 4. Flex Direction

```css
.container {
  flex-direction: row; /* default */
}
```

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `row` | Items placed left to right. |
| `row-reverse` | Items placed right to left. |
| `column` | Items placed top to bottom. |
| `column-reverse` | Items placed bottom to top. |

---

## 5. Main Axis Alignment — `justify-content`

```css
.container {
  justify-content: flex-start; /* default */
}
```

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `flex-start` | Items start at the beginning of the main axis. |
| `flex-end` | Items end at the main axis. |
| `center` | Items centered along the main axis. |
| `space-between` | Equal space between items. |
| `space-around` | Equal space around items (including ends). |
| `space-evenly` | Equal space between and around all items. |

---

## 6. Cross Axis Alignment — `align-items`

```css
.container {
  align-items: stretch; /* default */
}
```

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `stretch` | Items stretch to fill container height (if no height set). |
| `flex-start` | Items align at the start of cross axis. |
| `flex-end` | Items align at the end of cross axis. |
| `center` | Items centered along cross axis. |
| `baseline` | Items align based on their text baseline. |

---

## 7. Multiple Lines — `flex-wrap`

```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap; /* default */
}
```

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `nowrap` | All items in one line. |
| `wrap` | Items wrap to next line. |
| `wrap-reverse` | Items wrap but in reverse cross-axis direction. |

---

## 8. Combining Direction & Wrap — `flex-flow`

Shorthand for `flex-direction` + `flex-wrap`:

```css
.container {
  flex-flow: row wrap;
}
```

---

## 9. Aligning Multiple Lines — `align-content`

Works when **multiple lines** exist (`flex-wrap` is used):

```css
.container {
  align-content: flex-start;
}
```

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `flex-start` | Lines packed at start. |
| `flex-end` | Lines packed at end. |
| `center` | Lines centered. |
| `space-between` | Equal space between lines. |
| `space-around` | Equal space around lines. |
| `stretch` | Lines stretched to fit container. |

---

## 10. Controlling Flex Items Individually

### a) Order
```css
.item {
  order: 2; /* default is 0 */
}
```
Higher `order` means the item appears later in the layout.

### b) Grow — `flex-grow`
```css
.item {
  flex-grow: 1; /* item takes available space */
}
```
- `0` = don’t grow (default)
- `1` = grow proportionally

### c) Shrink — `flex-shrink`
```css
.item {
  flex-shrink: 1; /* default */
}
```
- `0` = don’t shrink
- `1` = shrink if space is tight

### d) Basis — `flex-basis`
```css
.item {
  flex-basis: 200px; /* starting size before grow/shrink */
}
```

### e) Shorthand — `flex`
```css
.item {
  flex: 1 0 200px; /* grow shrink basis */
}
```

### f) Align Self
```css
.item {
  align-self: flex-end;
}
```
Overrides `align-items` for individual items.

## 11. Responsive Flexbox Example

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 10px;
}

.item {
  flex: 1 1 200px;
}
```
This creates a responsive row of items that wrap into new rows as the screen shrinks.

---

## 12. Limitations of Flexbox
- Best for **one-dimensional layouts**, not full page grids.
- Complex nested flexboxes can get messy.
- Predictable sizing can be tricky with mixed-width items.
- Doesn’t create overlapping grid-like structures.

---

## 13. When to Use Flexbox vs Grid

| Use Flexbox when… | Use Grid when… |
|-------------------|----------------|
| You need to align items in a row or column. | You need layouts with both rows and columns. |
| Items should adapt naturally to available space. | You need precise two-dimensional placement. |
| Building navbars, cards, buttons, form controls. | Building dashboards, galleries, complex layouts. |

---

## 14. Best Practices
- Use `gap` instead of margins for spacing (simplifies alignment).
- Use `flex: 1` for equal-width flexible boxes.
- Keep axis direction in mind (main vs cross axis).
- Combine Flexbox for **components** inside **CSS Grid** layouts.

## 15. Real-world Example — Navigation Bar

```css
nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  background: #333;
  padding: 10px;
}

nav ul {
  display: flex;
  gap: 15px;
  list-style: none;
}

nav a {
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```
